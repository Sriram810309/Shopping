# 🚀 React App Starter – Powered by Create React App

This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) — a powerful toolchain for modern React apps.

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### ▶️ `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- Hot-reloads the page as you edit files.
- Lint errors and warnings will be shown in the console.

---

### 🧪 `npm test`

Launches the test runner in **interactive watch mode**.  
Ideal for TDD (Test Driven Development) and verifying functionality during development.

---

### 📦 `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder:

- Optimizes for performance and minifies files.
- File names include content-based hashes for better caching.

> Your app is **ready to be deployed**.

---

### 💥 `npm run eject`

**⚠️ Warning: This is irreversible!**

- Ejects all configuration (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
- Gives full control over the setup, but you're on your own afterward.

> Unless you need deep customizations, it’s best to avoid ejecting.

## 🐞 Common Issues

### ❌ `npm run build` fails to minify

This may happen due to unsupported JavaScript syntax (like optional chaining `?.`) in outdated versions of CRA or older `terser` plugins.

**Solution:**

- Ensure all dependencies are up to date.
- Use `react-scripts@latest`.
- Replace or polyfill incompatible code if necessary.
